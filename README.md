# final_vba_challenge
# VBA-Challenge
Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide Steve a workbook that he can use with a click of a button to analyze the 2017 and 2018 stock market.

Deliverables are as follows:

1: Pop-up question to view 2017 or 2017 analysis

2: Buttons to clear or view data

3: Refactored code for optimal performance with pop-up to show run-time results

Results
I used the (VBA_Challenge.xlsm) 2017 and 2018 data sets to create two additional tabs: DQ Analysis and All Stocks Analysis.

DQ Analysis Tab

The DQ Analysis tab provides the Total Daily Volume and Return.  This will Steve to view the total yearly volume and return for all the stocks.

All Stocks Analysis Tab

The All Stocks Analysis Tab visually displays the Total Daily Volume and Return for the following Stocks:
Tickers:
AY
CSIQ
DQ
ENPH
FSLR
HASI
JKS
RUN
SEDG
SPWR
TERP
VSLR 

Positive returns are noted in green and negative returns in red to easily view.  

This tab is interactive...When you click the 'Run Analysis for All Stocks' button, you get the below prompt to answer 'What year would you like to run the analysis on?'
When you add 2017 to data is autopopulated, and as a added bonus you get the run time measured in seconds.

Additionally, if you input 2018 that data is autopopulated and you'll also see the below run-time.


Summary of Code Refactoring Advantages & Disadvantages 
Disadvantages:
- Tedious
- Really never complete - you'll always find ways to make it better


Advantages are:
- More readable
- Less code to maintain
- Scalable
- Reliable
- Easier to troubleshoot
- Less comments because more readable
- Easier to test

Summary of VBA Code Refactoring Advantages & Disadvantages 
Refactoring this VBA Code refactoring was very tedious and mindblowing. As a newbie it can be difficult to understand how to shorten the code to get the same results. My focus is to learn the functionality and the loops, variables and conditions though when having to formulate a plan to reduce the noise, it can become very tedious. 

While tedious, the really like the final results, the code is more easier to understand with less comments and less work to revisit in the future
